# Edge-assisted Mobile AR (JAVA Code for Android Smartphones)

# Description
We modified the object detection demo in Tensorflow Lite to enable an Android smartphone to offload its real-time camera captured video frames to an edge server. We designed and implemented an edge-based mobile AR system to analyze the interactions between `AR configurations` and the mobile device's `energy consumption`. The edge server is developed to process received image frames and to send the detection results back to the Mobile AR client. Two major modules are implemented on the edge server: (i) the `communication handler` which establishes a `TCP socket` connection with the Mobile AR device and (ii) the `analytics handler` which performs object detection for the Mobile AR client. The analytics handler is designed based on a custom framework called Darknet with GPU acceleration and runs YOLOv3, a large Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) model.
