# Mobile-AR-in-Edge-Computing-Client
We modified the example of object detection in Tensorflow Lite to enable an Android smartphone to offload its real-time camera captured video frames to an edge server.
The connection between the edge server and the smartphone is built by a wireless TCP socket. We also implemented the wireless UDP socket.
